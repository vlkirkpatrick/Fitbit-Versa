This clock face doesn't do much besides tell the time, steps for the day, show the date and remind you that you are water fasting!
No special setup or buttons or actions. I just wanted a reminder that I would see often no matter where I was. 
Colors and text are not user configurable. They can only be changed in the Fitbit Studio and then you rebuild the app and install it 
on your Versa. 

This clock face is not for the Ionic. Versa with the 33.1.30 firmware update.

Use it as you will. It would be nice to know if someone found my work useful.
